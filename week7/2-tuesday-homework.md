Homework for Tuesday, July 19th
===============================

Contact Directory Project
-------------------------

This will be our **final** project!  A contact list/directory may sound boring, but we will spice it up with lots of features:

- Contact List
	- Sort Contacts
	- Filter/Search Contacts
- Contact Detail
	- See all contact details (Contact List will only show some fields)
- Add/Edit Contacts
	- Name
	- Email
	- Phone
	- Category (dropdown, friend/family/business/etc)
	- Photo
	- Notes field

The homework will be for you to start on building the project above.  Get at least the github repo and framework setup We'.

ll go over questions Thursday and explain a little bit on sorting/filtering/searching.

If we have time Thursday and everyone is up for it, we dive into **one** of these features:
- Pagination
- Photo upload
- Cordova (Android/iPhone native app)
