======================================

jQuery Weather App
------------------
Following the jQuery Zipcode example, create an application that where the user can enter a zip code, press a button, and have the weather information returned in some format.

I would like to see: The city/state, the temperature, and the current summary text.  Display these items in different elements, not all in one string.
