Blog Project: Add Modals
------------------------
In the Blog project we have been working on in the last few weeks, make the following changes:

- Change the form that is used to add/edit posts into a modal
- Add a Delete button in the modal
- Add am editable date field and sort by the date field

The code for the hitList (with modals) that we worked on in class is here: [hitList](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-class/tree/master/week6/examples/hitList).
